  <h1>New Site Launch — NAisGood.com</h1>

  <p>We love awesome, bold messaging in a slick and impressive design, especially if it adapts smartly and looks great on screens from massive to mini [ie. mobile]. That’s exactly why we love the site recently launched by Montréal creative marketing agency <a href="http://naisgood.com">N/A Creative</a>, a collaboration between Stresslimit [UX/architecture/tech], <a href="http://www.triborodesign.com/">Triboro Design</a> [visual design], and of course N/A themselves providing content, structure and direction as the site is about them after all.</p>

<p>We had gone through many different design &amp; aesthetic directions, all of which for one reason or another would have had problems adapting to different screen sizes, browser or connection uncertainty, etc. Not wanting to always be nay-sayers, we had to be on our toes to keep coming back with creative tech/design solutions to the visual designs coming down the pipe.<!-- more --></p>

<p>The site is powered by a customized WordPress backend that makes it incredibly easy to manage all text, images, pages and content, all the while looking as if each pixel was placed by an experienced designer.</p>

<p>This was a great collaboration of the kind we love — a real conversation between form &amp; functionality, with beautiful results. This is responsive design. <a href="http://naisgood.com">Check out the site</a> on different devices, or resize your browser to see how the site adapts.</p>
