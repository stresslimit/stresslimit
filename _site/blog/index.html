      <p>After a decade of Stresslimit Design, I have decided to move on to other things. There is no easy way to say how major a shift this is for me, so better to say it quickly, then add elaborate.</p>

      <p>We’re proud to have helped Jason Bodkin and <a href="http://enmasse.info">Montreal’s collaborative drawing project En Masse</a> redo their website recently. <a href="http://weshatch.com">Wes</a> really took the lead in setting up the information structure first, then iterating the design with the help of <a href="http://celinecelines.com">CelineCelines</a>’ design eye. This was an experiment in live-wireframing, and the experiment was definitely as success. It is still a work in progress, but we’re happy to show the results and so are En Masse.</p>

      <p>We do so much work for clients abroad (either in different countries or different continents), so we always love when we get the chance to meet face to face. We were therefore very excited to be able to go down to Washington D.C. to attend the Beyond Access 2012 Conference <a href="http://www.beyondaccess.net/conference2012/"><em>Local Alternatives for Global Development: Rediscovering Libraries </em></a>on October 3rd, put on by our client <a href="http://beyondaccess.net">Beyond Access</a>. In partnership with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the conference aims to explore the “how” of information access, bringing public libraries into discussions of development for the first time. This year, 20 library delegations from every continent were in attendance, presenting their innovative community ideas to over 300 participants.</p>

      <p>As Stresslimit evolves, we’ve realized that our current web presence isn’t quite doing is for us anymore. So we’re adapting it to better reflect where we are today, and where we’re headed. With a parallel approach to content, identity and technical development, we’re reworking our messaging, information architecture and design. As each member of the team brings their background and perspective to the table (we are literally all working around the same table), we hash out ideas and challenge possible directions.</p>

We met the team here through our friend and artist-entrepreneur <a href="http://littlebits.cc">Ayah Bdeir</a> founder of the space. It’s in a heritage building in classic Ottoman style, with a number of rooms giving onto a central meeting space [shown here], and also has a kitchen and garden. I mostly take meetings from here on Skype but would be great to host in-person meetings as well! We hope this pieds-à-terre will open doors for future business in the MENA region.</p>

      <p>I’m just in the final throes of completing a site, and it feels great. However, I recently took a moment to survey the bulk of the code I had generated, and I reflected upon the avenues for improvement and refinement. While such a thing is probably not wise immediately prior to signing off on something (as it could potentially lead to untimely code refactoring), I did identify a number of redundancies in my CSS that I thought could be easily cleaned up.</p>

      <p>We are very fortunate to be hosting an electronics workshop in our studio (a.k.a. the Woodshop). I’ll be running things, while tech whiz Adam Brown will be providing the technical expertise. We’re going to be doing basic soldering techniques as well as showing how to read / understand simple circuitry diagrams. And, to what end? Well, so that participants may assemble their very own futuristic light-controlled frequency oscillator. From the future.</p>

ONE YEAR!! So much has happened since then, but unfortunately so little in terms of collecting, organizing, and archiving the content that was produced and presented then… I have uploaded all images captured of the event by my friend <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/mariejuliegarneau/">Marie-Julie Garneau</a>. That is a first step. I will later on upload all power-point presentations to a CCMTL slideshare and share them. Also we have everything on tape!

      <p>Well, always one to give credit where credit’s due, I must say that I just spent 20 minutes geeking out over some of the CSS found at <a href="http://www.sorensonmedia.com">Sorenson media’s</a> nice site. Specifically, I am quite impressed with the particular usage of the ::before and ::after pseudoelements to create a subtle curled shadow underneath an element.

Although all important things of the office were moved [tables &amp; chairs, server, phone and other technology boxes], there was still plumbing and painting being done].
