  <h1>Still as Relevant as Ever: David Maister in the field</h1>
  <h6>November 14, 2011 • by colin</h6>

  

  <p>I love this stuff—hearing back from the “real world” about things that we’ve made for our clients.</p>

<p>My wife’s younger brother has graduated from <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/">McGill in Engineering</a>, and after doing a work term in the middle east with <a href="http://www.booz.com/">Booz &amp; Co</a>. based in Dubai, he has now taken a full-time position with this international management consulting outfit.</p>

<p>We were very excited when he texted a photograph and an incredulous note asking, “Someone at Booz suggested I read this book, is this the same STRESSLIMITDESIGN?!?!”</p>

<p>Short answer is yes.</p>

<p>Longer answer is that in 2007 our long-time client and friend <a href="http://davidmaister.com/">David Maister</a> wanted to publish a new book of material from his more recent articles and blog, but was less confident in the relevance of the mainstream publishing industry as a mechanism. We dove in with full force; designed the cover and entire book layout, searched and chose on-demand publishing providers, set a schedule and release strategy for the hardcover and softcover versions for early 2008. The book outsold all his previous books except for his original classic, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=davidmaisterc-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0684834316%2Fqid%3D1153181013%2Fsr%3D2-1%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_b_2_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D283155">Managing the Professional Service Firm</a></em>.</p>

<p>And the conclusion is: David Maister’s thinking and strategies for professional service firms are still relevant and still influencing top management consultants at a global level—we’re just glad to have been able to help.</p>
