  <p>I can say with certainty that we have officially “moved.” Quotation marks here indicate doubt as to the termination of this task. Although all important things of the office were moved [tables &amp; chairs, server, phone and other technology boxes], there was still plumbing and painting being done]. This means that the foosball table that has been waiting here for a couple weeks still doesn’t have a proper horizontal home. Soon though we will hear the happy orchestra of fingers tapping, computer fans whirring and foosballs banging, all very productive sounds!</p>

<p>So here is a space waiting to be filled, with: cutting-edge design, programming and all the organization that is needed in the web business; but also electronic art projects that use web, audio and physical engineering; music production and distribution; multi-purpose workshop space; and more!</p>

<p>Some new friends. Thinking of rewiring all our adapters like this so no one can use the power when they come visit.</p>

<p>Just waiting to accumulate some stress so we can blow it out on the foosball table.</p>

<p>There was some statistic somewhere that said moving was among the top 3 most stressful events that can happen in a person’s life—above car accident right under death of a parent. I’m not sure who they sampled but it seems to me moving is always much more full of excitement than stress; hopefully one is moving in order to go towards something, looking forwards to a new phase of life or projects or business [most likely all of the above].</p>

<p>That is exactly what this means for us right now.</p>
