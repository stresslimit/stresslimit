  <h2 id="the-last-10-years">The last 10 years</h2>

<p>We’ve made so many amazing things over the past 10 years! I love to think back with pride at some of our first projects as stresslimitdesign in the early 2000’s — <a href="http://mothersacrossamerica.com/">interactive training software for postpartum moms</a>, a European chamber orchestra, lots of other small businesses [robotics parts manufacturer, process improvement consultants, electric supply company, etc]. For this era we had this <a href="http://stresslimitdesign.com/previously/stresslimitdesign-v1">placeholder site</a>.</p>

<p>Technical highlights include pre-AJAX XMLHTTPRequest using iframes, pre-javascript framework library [yes I mean before prototype.js existed], pre-WordPress blogging platform, all home-engineered. I love the advances in open source since then, it means so much less engineering by us, and more engineering by tons of people everywhere.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>After a few years, 2 trends emerged in our successes: that our overly-attentive service and the far-reaching scope of our skills gave us better results in ventures where we worked at the very core of clients’ business models; and that those results worked best in 2 specific domains—thought leaders [authors and consultants who needed a high profile in their industry; eg. <a href="http://davidmaister.com/">David Maister</a>, <a href="http://juliensmith.com/">Julien Smith</a>, <a href="http://www.chrisbrogan.com/work-with-me/">Chris Brogan</a>, among others] and startups [especially those in the early stages of development; eg. <a href="http://startcooking.com">Start Cooking</a>]. We also got a new <a href="http://stresslimitdesign.com/previously/stresslimitdesign-v2">one-page interim site</a> which highlighted our continued video work.</p>

<p>Since then we have worked for big names [an internal blogging project for Microsoft, an <a href="http://fedex.stresslimitdesign.com/">interactive html5 infographic</a> for a FedEx blog] and lesser-known or emerging ones [too numerous to name]. We have also jumped deep into the open source word of WordPress as it has evolved, <a href="http://www.zackgrossbart.com/blog/about-zack/">collaborating</a> on several <a href="http://stresslimitdesign.com/about-our-wordpress-expertise#plugins">popular WordPress plugins</a> [one of which has been chosen on the shortlist of WordPress.com VIP plugins]. The divergence in activity led us to reduce our “coming soon” page to a <a href="http://stresslimitdesign.com/previously/stresslimitdesign-v3">pretty minimal one</a>, then one only <a href="http://stresslimitdesign.com/previously/stresslimitdesign-v4">slightly more elaborate</a>.</p>

<p>All this and we never had a “real” website.</p>

<h2 id="the-last-10-weeks">The last 10 weeks</h2>

<p>Reading our past few posts we’ve obviously been “going through changes”. But that hasn’t stopped us from continuing to do amazing work for amazing folks. After helping <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/08/heads-up-techcrunch-will-look-a-little-different-next-week/">TechCrunch with their recent relaunch</a>, we have been consulting with the <a href="http://vip.wordpress.com/">WordPress.com VIP Services</a> team at <a href="http://automattic.com">Automattic</a> to reposition their service offerings.</p>

<p>We’ve also taken on a brand launch strategy and build for local <a href="http://goodmrktng.com">Good Marketing team N/A Creative</a>, and are finishing up a WordPress plugin for an online social media services product with lots of clients in the WordPress.com VIP program [will announce the name when it launches].</p>

<h2 id="the-next-10-months">The next 10 months</h2>

<p>Bigger is not better. We need to stay small to stay awesome. We will be continuing to focus on one realm which has become our forté which is high-level WordPress technical implementation, but also leaving room to <a href="http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2010/05/13/focusing-on-eve.html">focus on everything</a>.</p>

<p>Re-shaping our process to be highly based on ultra-organized project management, working with the group of experts in our extended family.</p>

<p>Collaborating with interesting people and organizations pushing the envelope where good design thinking meets technology and social innovation.</p>
