We're at the Mozilla Festival in London! As part of the session we are leading about [Building Books for the Open Web](http://mozillafestival.org/schedule/sessions/building-books-for-the-open-web/), we are going to drink our own kool-aid and make a book using [PressBooks](http://pressbooks.com) about the conference and topics and themes discussed here. There are already so many interesting people around doing great projects here and in the rest of their lives, that we're super excited to document and continue to discuss.

So if you're at MozFest right now and want **to get involved**, send an email to [mozfest@stresslimitdesign.com](mailto:mozfest@stresslimitdesign.com) and we can sign you up to help!
