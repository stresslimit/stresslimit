### Stresslimit is expanding; we need more tech hands on deck.


We are a small, expert web design & develop shop in Montreal, and we need a coder. [We love WordPress](http://stresslimitdesign.com/about-our-wordpress-expertise), and at this point do almost everything with it, so you really need to be focussed on and love WP too.

**Skills & Requirements**



	
  * must speak and write English well to communicate with clients [although internal communication can be in French]

	
  * must be very self-starting, to the point of bugging us to see what you can do next, and/but even better, just doing something that you see needs doing

	
  * must be a healthily obsessive-compulsive personality, and NEED to make clean, efficient, DRY, awesome code—on the front-end and backend

	
  * of course must be an experienced LAMP developer with significant WordPress experience [themes + plugins]; we will ask for code samples, links to wp.org, github, etc.

	
  * must be up to date on css/js tricks & quirks, browser progress developments, cultural shifts in the web/tech world, and generally have a nerdy aspect to your personality when it comes to web work

	
  * as excited about technically challenging work as you are about taking care of simple stuff as cleanly and quickly as possible

	
  * same as above for front-end vs backend: as excited about doing interesting front-end work as slickly as possible even if the backend is straightforward, and vice-versa

	
  * interest in blogging/speaking about your work is a plus but not required

	
  * bonus points if you have done LSD and count it as a life-changing experience [hey it was [good enough for Steve Jobs](http://www.thefix.com/content/steve-jobs-think-different-and-lsd-9143)]
