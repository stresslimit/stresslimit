I was recently reminded by [@jkudish](http://twitter.com/jkudish) that it's time to start thinking [well ahead] about WordCamp Montreal in August, and since we [sponsored](http://2011.montreal.wordcamp.org/sponsor/stresslimit/) and [spoke](http://2011.montreal.wordcamp.org/session/wordpress-custom-post-types-in-depth/) last year I'd love to do both again. Checking out the [WordCamp Montreal](http://2012.montreal.wordcamp.org/be-a-speaker/schedule/) apply to speak page, I see myself and Joey giving our talk about custom content types, plus a cameo by WCMTL organizer [Jeremy Clark](http://simianuprising.com/contact/) [sitting down at left].

Great memories, and we're looking forward to another great event this year.
