We are proud to announce and show off our temporary Stresslimit headquarters in the Middle East here in Beirut, at Beirut's media lab & collaborative space [Karaj Beirut](http://www.karajbeirut.org/) [كراج  بيروت]. We met the team here through our friend and artist-entrepreneur [Ayah Bdeir](http://littlebits.cc) founder of the space. It's in a heritage building in classic Ottoman style, with a number of rooms giving onto a central meeting space [shown here], and also has a kitchen and garden. I mostly take meetings from here on Skype but would be great to host in-person meetings as well! We hope this pieds-à-terre will open doors for future business in the MENA region.
