After almost 10 years of creating [amazing](/editorial-calendar-plugin) [things](/power-of-scale) [for](http://trustedadvisor.com) [amazing](http://www.chrisbrogan.com/what-i-do/) [people](http://juliensmith.com), after some major restructuring, and hot on the heels of a bunch of sprints including helping [TechCrunch launch their ambitious redesign](http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/08/heads-up-techcrunch-will-look-a-little-different-next-week/), Stresslimit will be [mostly] on sabbatical for the month of August 2011.

We strongly believe that slowing down and taking time to reflect can only lead to stronger resolution, clearer heads, and more energy, creativity and inspiration in the long term.

When we get back: we are lining up what the fall looks like right now, and already have some exciting things in place. Stay tuned, and reach out if you're curious.
