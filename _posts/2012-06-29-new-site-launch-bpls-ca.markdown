We are very happy to announce another example of what we love about "beauty in simplicity", our latest site in collaboration with [Marc Kandalaft design [logo design]](http://www.marckandalaft.com/), [Florin Gabor studio [web design]](http://floringaborstudio.com/), the Stresslimit team [conception, UI/UX, information architecture, content development, production/programming and project management], and of course a wonderful client Mike Pickering and his team at [Best Practice Learning Solutions](http://bpls.ca/).

As the newest associate consultant and official Canadian partner of our good friends at [Trusted Advisor Associates](http://trustedadvisor.com), Mike contacted us to update his image with a new logo & colour palette, and a new website to better communicate his services and offering. The site we made is simple, beautiful, clear, concise, and of course adaptive for different device screen sizes.
